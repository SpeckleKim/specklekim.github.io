# RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation

## What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful AI technique that combines the strengths of large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge retrieval systems. Instead of relying solely on pre-trained knowledge, RAG systems can access and incorporate up-to-date, domain-specific information to generate more accurate and relevant responses.

## How RAG Works

### 1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
- Extract text from various sources (PDF, web pages, databases)
- Divide text into chunks (sentences or paragraphs)
- Convert to unified document format

### 2. **Embedding Generation & Storage**
- Each chunk is vectorized through embedding models
- Generated vectors are stored in vector database
- Metadata (document source, creation date, category) is stored together

### 3. **Query Processing**
- Transform user queries into search representations
- Query decomposition and refinement may occur
- Convert to vector or keyword format for search

### 4. **Retrieval**
- Vectorize query using embedding model
- Search for most similar chunks in vector store
- Can use hybrid search (BM25 keyword-based + vector search)
- Utilize metadata for filtering and sorting

### 5. **Generation**
- Include retrieved chunks in prompt to LLM
- Model generates responses based on reference documents
- Post-process the response

## Key Components

### Knowledge Base
- **Vector Database**: Stores document embeddings for semantic search
- **Document Store**: Contains the actual text content
- **Indexing**: Efficient retrieval mechanisms

### Retrieval System
- **Embedding Models**: Convert text to vector representations
- **Similarity Search**: Find most relevant documents
- **Reranking**: Improve relevance through multiple passes

### Language Model
- **Context Window**: Handles retrieved information
- **Generation**: Produces coherent, accurate responses
- **Integration**: Combines retrieved and trained knowledge

## RAG Architecture Understanding

### Preprocessing - Unified Document Processing
- Analyze and classify documents for storage
- Convert to unified format (images to text, tables to structured format)
- Transform various formats into standardized documents

### Storage & Classification - Organize in Library
- Attach metadata (tags) to documents for classification
- Classify in chunks and store
- Determine classification categories (humanities, engineering, etc.) to improve search efficiency

### Query - Convert Questions to Search Terms
- Convert user questions to vectors or keywords for searchable format
- Like a librarian understanding which books to find based on your question

### Retriever - Select Books from Shelves
- Use queries to find relevant books or chapters
- Accurate information retrieval with sufficient classification and metadata
- Can retrieve related materials together

### Generator - Read Materials and Answer
- Generate answers based on retrieved documents
- Synthesize multiple materials and connect context for understandable answers
- Like a knowledgeable person explaining books

### Visualization - Answer Reliability & Usability
- Display reference sources to improve answer reliability
- Better information acquisition and understanding with references and graphs

## RAG System Example: Library Analogy

### Example Query
**Question**: "Can you tell me about popular healthy diet plans and exercise methods these days?"

**Answer**: "These days, the Mediterranean diet is popular. A diet with one meal focused on protein and the rest on vegetables and fruits is effective. For exercise, 20 minutes of 'plank + stair climbing' is highly recommended."

## RAG System Information Processing Process

### Step 1: Question Analysis
**English**: "Can you tell me about popular healthy diet plans and exercise methods these days?"
- Question analysis: Need to reference nutrition papers and understand current SNS trends
- Problem-solving question analysis, efficient storage and search requires prediction of questions

### Step 2: Preprocessing
- **Paper books** → Text conversion using OCR
- **YouTube** → Captioning then script extraction
- **Blogs, SNS, News** → Crawling, HTML processing
- **Papers** → PDF document upload

### Step 3: Classification
- **Topic**: Diet / Exercise / Psychology / Success stories
- **Format**: Papers / Articles / Video summaries / Reviews
- **Tags**: 2030s / Severe obesity / Weight maintenance

### Step 4: Storage
- Chunking and storage based on classification
- Add metadata (title, date, keywords) to documents and chunks
- Connect images and related documents

### Step 5: Retrieval
Query decomposition and refinement:
- Diet plans that reduce carbs while maintaining satiety
- Aerobic exercises that can be done at home
- Popular diet keywords from the past year
- Meta search using main entities (diet=diet, nutrition, exercise)
- Hybrid search using query words and sentences
- Sorting and filtering using dates and related documents

### Step 6: Generation
**Final Answer**: "These days, the Mediterranean diet is popular. A diet with one meal focused on protein and the rest on vegetables and fruits is effective. For exercise, 20 minutes of 'plank + stair climbing' is highly recommended."

### Step 7: UX/UI
- Display related image popups
- Reference material links
- Related question recommendations

## Key Insight: The Retriever is the Heart of RAG

In RAG architecture, the **most crucial component is the retrieval stage (Retriever)**. While many think LLMs generate answers, the reality is that **"how well appropriate information is retrieved"** determines the quality of responses.

First, collect data and divide it into paragraphs or sentences. These are called **chunks**, which are then vectorized through embedding models. These vectors are stored in a vector database, along with metadata like document sources and dates.

When a user asks a question, the query is vectorized again and sent as a search request to the vector database. This is the Retrieval stage - the heart of RAG. How well relevant chunks are retrieved determines whether the model can generate proper answers. You can also use keyword-based search like BM25, meta filtering, or hybrid search.

Finally, the retrieved information is passed to the LLM, which generates responses based on it. This is the Generation stage. But again, the model only generates answers within the "retrieved information." Therefore, if the search is wrong, even the smartest model will give wrong answers.

**Conclusion**: In RAG architecture, what's truly important is not the LLM, but the Retriever. Search determines over 80% of performance - please remember this point.

## RAG Architecture Patterns

### Basic RAG
```
Query → Retrieval → Augmentation → Generation → Response
```

### Advanced RAG
```
Query → Query Processing → Retrieval → Reranking → 
Context Assembly → Generation → Response
```

### Multi-Step RAG
```
Query → Initial Retrieval → Query Refinement → 
Secondary Retrieval → Synthesis → Generation → Response
```
